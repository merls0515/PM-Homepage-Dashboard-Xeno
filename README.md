🧩 Problem Statement

Design the first screen after login for a retail marketer using Xeno, such that the screen:

Helps marketers quickly understand what’s happening across campaigns, customers, and revenue

Enables them to take the most meaningful and impactful actions with minimal effort

The goal was not just to design a dashboard, but to create a decision and action hub aligned with Xeno’s mission of AI-powered personalization and profitable growth.

🏢 About Xeno (Context)

Difficult to personalize at scale

Hard to identify what’s working and what needs attention

Needs to prove ROI and act quickly

What they need on login:

A clear performance snapshot

Actionable recommendations, not just data

🧠 Product Thinking & Design Principles

The homepage was designed using three guiding principles:

Revenue-First
Focus on metrics and insights that directly impact revenue and retention.

Action-Oriented
Every insight is paired with a clear next step or CTA.

Persona-Centric
Insights are organized around customer behavior and journeys, not just channels.

Increase in campaigns launched via recommendations

Improvement in personalization score

These metrics measure real behavioral impact, not just usage.

🔮 Future Iterations

All future enhancements follow the same philosophy:
Show value fast → enable action faster.
